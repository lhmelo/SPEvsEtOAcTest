This project contains my most up-to-date version of the Targeted-analysis B-MIS code, written by Angie Boysen.  This version has been optomized to work with my R configuration and datasets.

B-MIS-Normalization_TQS_ProCyanoAq_NAsremoved.Rmd is the version to use as a template.

QCed Skyline output should be subjected to QC_cleanup (use QCcleanup_CyanoAq.Rmd as template) prior to beginning B-MIS script. QC_cleanup removes compounds which were not detected in any sample and fills missing data with blank values.
